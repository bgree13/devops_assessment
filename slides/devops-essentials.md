# DevOps Essentials


## Introduction

This course is designed to introduce you to the concept of DevOps in general as well as how it evolved.

We are going to cover terms and technology that either directly influence the DevOps movement or led us down that path.

DevOps is nothing without understanding some of the fundamental processes that are impacted by the new way of operating, we will cover those as well.

Not only is DevOps the driver of many new tools in the Open Source world, but a large consumer of them as well. We will talk about the leading concepts and DevOps Best Practices.


## What is DevOps?

Although it may mean different things to different people, there is an official definition that we are going to use, from Wikipedia:

…is a software development method that stresses communication, collaboration (information sharing and web service usage), integration, automation, and measurement of cooperation between software developers and other information-technology (IT) professionals. 

DevOps acknowledges the interdependence of software development, quality assurance, and IT operations, and aims to help an organization rapidly produce software products and services and to improve operations performance.


## What Is It Really?

+ It is *NOT* an excuse for staff reductions

+ The is no single DevOps tool

+ It **IS** a cross-functional mode of working
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: It’s a different way of doing things in Information Technology. What it is NOT is an excuse for staff reductions (which all too often it is used to justify or explain). 

A lot of people believe that one tool be it Jenkins, Puppet, Maven will be able encompass their DevOps goals. When in fact, it’s quite the opposite. A collection of these tools should be used to achieve the full development and delivery process.

Over the course you will hear things like “continuous integration” and “build automation” and “treating your infrastructure like code”.
