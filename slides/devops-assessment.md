# DevOps Assessment


## Continous Deployment Pipeline 
 <!-- .slide: class="absolute" -->
![alt text](images/cont_deployment.png "Continuous Deployment")


## Purpose
The goal of the exercise is to evaluate both the current and desired state of your organizations progress and finding the best path to achieve future goals. In order to do so, we will expose opportunities for continuous improvement by defining a baseline of where you are on your journey and the desired state of where you’re trying to go.

Once complete we will compile the results and identify any gaps that may inhibit us from achieving these set goals. From this we can generate custom guidelines that will be used to visualize our paths to success.

## Shared View
We need a shared view of where we are and a shared destination
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

+ Where we are Today?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
+ Where do we want to be Tomorrow?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
+ How do we plan to get there?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


## Scoping

Assessing the service offerings and what value is being added by each shared service. We want to determine key priorities by developing a system that can be used to calculate an "Initiative Score" per project / initiative.  

Here we will focus on an IT service and the groups who provide it.

+ Management
+ Operations
+ Development
+ Security
+ Support
+ DevOps


## Goal Setting

Developing an action plan to achieve the results we desire. We want to set prioritization on the most impactful projects / initiatives based on an “Initiative Score.”  The goal here is to determine what does our ideal process flow look like per service offering? Are we working to solve problems that need to be solved to make a difference for our business in an automated fashion?


## Rating Scale

+ 0 | Not planned
+ 1 | Planned
+ 2 | Inconsistently implemented in some areas
+ 3 | Consistently implemented in some areas
+ 4 | Consistently implemented throughout the organization


## Scoring & Rules

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Quantify the amount of work required to achieve said goals.
